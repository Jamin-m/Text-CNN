### Text-CNN for Chinese text classification

------

> This repo implements Text-CNN to classify Chinese text by PyTorch. And Text-CNN was proposed in Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (Yoon Kimï¼Œ2014).

if you have pre-trained word vector, put it in '/pretrain'.



Besides, you can run the following code to view parameters which I provide a brief description.

```
python3 main.py -h 
```



You may run by

```
python3 main.py
```

Also, you can change some parameters to satisfy specific purposes (eg. add `-lr 0.01` to change the default value of learning rate).
